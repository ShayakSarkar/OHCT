Write the following function in C++

    std::string nth_string(std::vector<char> symbols,int n)

    specifications:
        given a vector of symbols, the function should return the nth string
        that can be formed from those symbols

        ex:
            symbols=[@,a,c,#,&,v]
            1st string = @
            2nd string = a
            6th string = v
            7th string = @@
            10th string = @#
            13th string = a@
        
        the function should perform better than O(n)
