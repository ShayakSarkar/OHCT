Write the following function in python3

	int generate_id()
	
	specifications: 
		each time generate id is called it should return 1 more than what it had returned on its last call
		ex: 
			generate_id() --> 1
			generate_id() --> 2
			generate_id() --> 3
			
			
		you can make use of a file to store the last id that was generated so 
		make use of the contents of that file to generate the new id
		first return value of the function should be 1
